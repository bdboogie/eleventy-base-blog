Mandatory Challenge from this was to write Pseudocode for one or more of the following
Reading list
Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!
Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and already read (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).
Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: “The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien”.
Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like ‘You already read “The Hobbit” by J.R.R. Tolkien’, and if not, log a string like ‘You still need to read “The Lord of the Rings” by J.R.R. Tolkien.’
Recipe List
Create an object to hold information on your favourite recipes. It should have properties for:
recipeTitle (a string)
servings (a number)
ingredients (an array of strings)
directions (a string)
List all recipes
Create a loop to list all the ingredients.
FixStart
Create a function called fixStart. It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurrences of its first character have been replaced with ‘*****’, except for the first character itself. You can assume that the string is at least one character long. For example:
fixStart('babble'): 'ba**le'
fixStart('turtle'): 'tur*le'
