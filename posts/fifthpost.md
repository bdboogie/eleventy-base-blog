Well I made a right mess of that , adding the default.njk content kicked everything out and the site wouldnt rebuild , so I added a load of 'dodgy' investigative fixes that have now ended up in the current build 
This was the offending siote that I obviously failed to follow correctly although I dont think it helped that I wasdnt using 'Parcel', I assume touch just means create a file, which I simulated by right clicking in VSCode

I have however found this useful site that I need to gen up on a bit more.
