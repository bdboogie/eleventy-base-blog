I Got a bit attached to the support message linked to every pages through the base.njk file.  Then I thought why not add it to the first post and refer to it there, freeing up a lovely bit of real estate ont eh page. Splendid.

## Section Header

I made a bit of a "how you say in English 'Balls up'" trying to retain the message in this post as I accidently added the above secton to the base.njk file and when I saved it obvs it got added to every page , D'Oh.

``` text/2-3
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```
