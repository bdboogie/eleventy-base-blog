Tidy up time! The reminder to complete the submission form has propmpted me to go back through the weekly tasks and tidy up some of the taks that were left for further investigation.

## Section Header

<a href="{{ '/posts/firstpost/' | url }}">First post</a>
<a href="{{ '/posts/thirdpost/' | url }}">Third post</a>

Part of the tidy up is renaming the above to be relevant, A thought as I'm typing, if this is post two Post three wouldnt be avaialbel in realtime. I'm assuming if the third post is not available the text becomes a dead link rather than an error on the page.
